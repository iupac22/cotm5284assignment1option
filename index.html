  <p>
    I designed this website as an exercise to my programming and application course (COTM5284). 
    The site will organize my experience of the course all different pages of the site 
    containing all of my exercises.
    Assignment one of the course is concerned with designing a website that will be paced on a 
    repository on my hard disk. The second assignment is concerned with pushing the repository 
    of the website design to host sites such as github and explore how version controls systems work. 
    The remaining assignments three and four are to be updated on this site when 
    I managed to complete them as per the course schedule.
